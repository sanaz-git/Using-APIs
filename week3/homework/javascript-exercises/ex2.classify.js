// Exercise 2: Classify

// In this exercise you'll read a little story. It's your job to turn the characters in it into classes and instantiate the class
//  into the characters you read about!

// # STORY

// Abdulkareem is a 35 year old man, that lives in Riyadh. He has a wife and 3 children. 
// As a day job he's a construction worker, that makes houses. He likes to eat dates and smoke water pipe.
// Abdulkareem has a horse, named Adel. The horse is 15 years old and has the color brown.
//  Usually the horse eats grass or helps transport materials for Abdulkareem.
// And they lived happily ever after!

// Create a class for Adbulkareem and Adel
// Instantiate those classes to create an Abdulkareem object and Adel object
